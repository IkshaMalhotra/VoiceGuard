# VoiceGuard – Advanced Voice Authentication
Passwords are hard to remember and often insecure. VoiceGuard replaces them with advanced voice authentication, creating a unique voiceprint for each user. And if the environment is noisy, or your device doesn’t support voice, you can switch seamlessly to pattern authentication.

## Overview
VoiceGuard is a secure, user-friendly authentication system that combines **voice biometrics** and **pattern-based login**.  
It aims to move beyond traditional passwords by providing a **multi-modal authentication** approach that is secure, accessible, and inclusive.

## Features
- **Voice Authentication** – Captures and processes voice samples to create a unique voiceprint.  
- **Multi-Sample Enrollment** – Improves reliability by storing multiple samples per user.  
- **Pattern Authentication** – Alternative login option with a dot-grid pattern system.  
- **Dual-Mode Security** – Supports both voice and pattern authentication for flexibility.  
- **Accessibility** – Voice mode for visually impaired users, pattern mode for hearing-impaired or speech-limited users.  
- **Modern UI** – Polished interface with real-time feedback (waveforms and interactive patterns).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Voice Processing**: Web APIs (Web Speech API / AudioContext)  
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (prototype implementation)

## How It Works
1. **Enrollment**  
   - Record your voice sample or set a pattern.  
   - Multiple samples can be recorded for better accuracy.  

2. **Authentication**  
   - Provide a new voice input or redraw your pattern.  
   - The system compares it with stored data to verify identity.  

3. **Fallback & Flexibility**  
   - Users can switch between voice and pattern authentication anytime.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **machine learning–based voice recognition APIs** for higher accuracy and spoof resistance.  
- Support for **multilingual voiceprints**, considering accent and tone variations.  
- Backend integration for **secure cloud-based storage**.  
- Expansion into **applications such as banking, IoT, and enterprise security**.
